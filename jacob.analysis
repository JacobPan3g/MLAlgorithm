1.	Empty Loop: 1e8 times, take 22.5s

2.	The decision tree bulid process:(GINI, matlab ignore the data-load time)
	High	1		4
	MATLAB	10.6s	21.68s
	C++		0.04s	0.14s
	[CONCLUSION] C++ is faster than MATLAB without matrix calculation.

3.	GINI
	min the Gini, which means that separate the cases as the real.
	ie. It will not let the tmpN1 or tmpN2 == 0.
